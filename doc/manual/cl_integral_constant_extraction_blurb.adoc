Since this class wraps `{ce_std_integral_constant}<{V}, ++/*...*/++>`,
there are two ways to extract the underlying value from it.
The first way is to write `{W}<{T}>::value`.
This directly accesses the underlying value and always works as
expected.
The second, shorter way is to write `{W}<{T}>()`.
This constructs an instance of the class, which will be implicitly
converted to the underlying value in most contexts, but not all.
When in doubt, use the first way.
