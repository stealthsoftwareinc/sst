----

The `sst_get_distro` function identifies the system type and stores it
in the `sst_distro` variable.

The following results are possible:
`alpine`,
`arch`,
`centos`,
`cygwin`,
`debian`,
`fedora`,
`homebrew`,
`macports`,
`msys2`,
`rhel`,
`ubuntu`,
or `unknown`.

:fp_cache_variable: sst_distro
include::bl_function_result_cache_variable_fragment.adoc[]

All possible results, including those added in the future, are
guaranteed to be spelled such that `$sst_distro` is unaffected by word
splitting and pathname expansion.
