In {cpp}20 and later, signed integer types are required to use two`'s
complement representation{cr_cpp20_requires_2c_fno}.
Before {cpp}20, signed integer types are permitted to use ones`'
complement or sign-magnitude representation instead, in which case
negative zero may be a trap representation{cr_negative_zero_trap_fno}.
