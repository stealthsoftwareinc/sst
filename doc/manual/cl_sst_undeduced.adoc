The `{cl_sst_undeduced}` trait defines `_R_` to `T` itself, making it
functionally equivalent to the `{cl_sst_type_identity}` trait.
The difference is only of style: both of these traits can be used to
prevent {cl_template_argument_deduction} from occurring, in which case
using `{cl_sst_undeduced}` is a better indication of intent than using
`{cl_sst_type_identity}`.
