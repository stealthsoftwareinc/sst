sst_array_cmp <array1> <array2>
----

The `sst_array_cmp` function compares two arrays.
The arrays are compared in lexical order first on their keys, and then
on their values.
The result is `-1`, `0`, or `1`.
The result is printed to standard output in <<bl_sst_csf>> form.

WARNING: This function currently does not work properly when either of
the arrays is an associative array.
This is planned to be fixed in the future.
// TODO: Fix this. The difficulty is that ${!xs[@]} is not necessarily
// sorted.
