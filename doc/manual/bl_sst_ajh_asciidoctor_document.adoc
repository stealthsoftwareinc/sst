== Images

`asciidoctor` will be called with `-a imagesdir=images`, meaning that
`image::foo.png[]` will reference `images/foo.png`, not `foo.png`.
So, to use images, create an `images` directory, put your images in it,
and reference them accordingly.

You can create subdirectories under the `images` directory to help
organize your images.
For example, if you create `images/foo/bar.png`, you can reference it
with `image::foo/bar.png[]`.

Asciidoctor Diagram will output images to the `images` directory using
the name pattern

You should avoid this name pattern for your own images, as the build
system sometimes deletes all such images.

You can change the name of the `images` directory by setting `imagesdir`
in `<json>`.
