[#bl-sst-am-distribute-if-not-dir]
= The `sst_am_distribute_if_not_dir` function

[source,subs="{sst_subs_source}"]
----
include::partials/bl_include_prelude.adoc[]

sst_am_distribute_if_not_dir [<path>]...
----

The `sst_am_distribute_if_not_dir` function adds each `<path>` to the
distributed files list, but skips `<path>` if it exists as a directory.

`<path>` must either exist as a file, exist as a directory, or not
exist.
A repeated `<path>` will be skipped, even across multiple calls.

This function must not be called from a subshell.
