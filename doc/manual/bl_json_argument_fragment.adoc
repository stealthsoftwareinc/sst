`<{fp_argument_name}>` specifies the JSON value on which to run `jq`.
If `<{fp_argument_name}>` is a single `-` character, the JSON value is
read from standard input.
Otherwise, if `<{fp_argument_name}>` begins with a `/`, `A-Z`, `a-z`,
`0-9`, `.`, `_`, or `-` character, it is taken to be a path to a file
from which to read the JSON value.
Otherwise, `<{fp_argument_name}>` is taken literally as the JSON value.
If the input is actually a sequence of JSON values, all but the first
JSON value is ignored.
