----

The `sst_get_distro_version` function identifies the system version and
stores it in the `sst_distro_version` variable.

The following results are possible for the various
xref:bl_sst_get_distro.adoc#bl-sst-get-distro[`sst_get_distro`]
values:

`centos`::
`6`,
`7`,
`8`,
or `unknown`.

`ubuntu`::
`16.04`,
`18.04`,
`20.04`,
or `unknown`.

`unknown`:: `unknown`.

:fp_cache_variable: sst_distro_version
include::bl_function_result_cache_variable_fragment.adoc[]

All possible results, including those added in the future, are
guaranteed to be spelled such that `$sst_distro_version` is unaffected
by word splitting and pathname expansion.
