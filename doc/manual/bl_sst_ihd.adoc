[#bl-sst-ihd]
= The `sst_ihd` function

.Bash

sst_ihd [<n>]
----

The `sst_ihd` function copies the content of standard input to standard
output, removing `<n>` space characters from the beginning of each line.
Lines that do not begin with `<n>` space characters are left unchanged.

If all lines are empty, all lines are left unchanged.
Otherwise, if `<n>` is omitted, it is taken to be the length stem:[k] of
the longest possible sequence of space characters at the beginning of
the first nonempty line, which may be zero.
Otherwise, if `<n>` is negative, it is adjusted to
stem:[\max\left(k + \mathtt{<n>}, 0\right)].

If the input is empty, the output will be empty.
Otherwise, a trailing newline character will be appended to the last
line of output if not already present.

The "`ihd`" abbreviation in the function name is short for
"`**i**ndented **h**ere-**d**ocument`".
