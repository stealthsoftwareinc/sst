[#cl-sst-count-it]
= The `sst::count_it` function

.{cpp}
[source,cpp,subs="{sst_subs_source}"]
----
#include <link:{repo_browser_url}/src/c-cpp/include/sst/catalog/count_it.hpp[sst/catalog/count_it.hpp,window=_blank]>
namespace sst {

template<{cl_req_Iterator} T, {cl_std_integral} N>
_R_ count_it(T x, N n);

}
----

The `{cl_sst_count_it}` function returns an iterator that compares equal
to the iterator that would be produced by `{cl_std_advance}(x, n)`.

The type `_R_` of the returned iterator is unspecified.
However, the following guarantees are made:

. {empty}
The return types of
`{cl_sst_count_it}(x, n)`
and
`{cl_sst_wrap_it}(x, n)`
are the same.

. {empty}
The return types of
`{cl_sst_count_it}(x, n)`
and
`{cl_sst_wrap_it}(x, n)`
are the same.
