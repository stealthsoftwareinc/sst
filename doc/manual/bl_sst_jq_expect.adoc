[#bl-sst-jq-expect]
= The `sst_jq_expect` function

.Bash
[source,subs="{sst_subs_source}"]

sst_jq_expect <condition> **[**<format> **[**<arg>**...]]**
----

The `sst_jq_expect` function checks a condition on JSON input using the
`jq` utility and terminates the script if the condition is false.

The JSON input is read from standard input.

The `<condition>` argument specifies the condition to check.
It should be a `jq` filter that outputs `true` or `false`.

If the condition is true, no action is taken.
Otherwise, the script is terminated by calling
`<<bl_sst_barf>> **[**<format> **[**<arg>**...]]**`.
