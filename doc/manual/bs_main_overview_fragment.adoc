The {fp_package_name} build system is based on the {bs_gnu_autotools}.
Before you can start using the build system, you need to identify which
__((package format))__ of {fp_package_name} you're working with.
{fp_package_name} is available in three different package formats:

1. The __((source repository))__.
2. A __((distribution archive))__.
3. [[bs_distribution_repository]]
A __((distribution repository))__.

To identify which package format you're working with, use the following
algorithm:

1. If you didn't start with a version control repository, i.e., you
started with an archive file named something like
`{fp_package_tarname}-<version>.tar.gz` or
`{fp_package_tarname}-<version>.zip` that extracts to a directory that
includes a file named `Makefile.in`, then you're working with a
distribution archive.
2. Otherwise, if the version control repository includes a file named
`Makefile.in` in the root directory, then you're working with a
distribution repository.
3. Otherwise, you're working with the source repository.

IMPORTANT: If you started with an archive file that does not extract to
a directory that includes a file named `Makefile.in`, then you may have
mistakenly downloaded a __((source archive))__.
This is what you will typically get if you use a download button when
viewing the source repository in a repository manager like GitLab or
GitHub.
{fp_package_name} does not support being built from a source archive.

Once you know which package format you're working with, using the build
system consists of three main steps:

1. _Initializing_ the build system.
((("build system, initializing")))
2. _Configuring_ the build system.
((("build system, configuring")))
3. _Running_ the build system.
((("build system, running")))

If you're working with the source repository, you need to perform steps
1, 2, and 3.
Otherwise, you only need to perform steps 2 and 3.
Step 1 is only designed to work on modern Linux systems with a variety
of tools installed, but steps 2 and 3 are designed to work on a variety
of Unix-like systems with minimal tools installed.
The idea is that developers work with the source repository and produce
distribution archives and distribution repositories for general use.
