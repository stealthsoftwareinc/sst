[#cl-sst-get-bit]
= The `sst::get_bit` function

.{cpp}
[source,cpp]
----
#include <sst/bit.h>
namespace sst {

// (1)
template<class X, class Q, class R>
constexpr bool get_bit(X x, Q q, R r) noexcept;

// (2)
template<class X, class R>
constexpr bool get_bit(X x, R r) noexcept;

// (3)
template<class Q, class R>
bool get_bit(void const * x, Q q, R r) noexcept;

// (4)
template<class R>
bool get_bit(void const * x, R r) noexcept;

}
----

The `sst::get_bit` function returns the bit at index
stem:[\mathtt{q} \cdot \mathtt{CHAR\_BIT} + \mathtt{r}]
of the two`'s complement representation of `x` +(for (1) and (2))+ or
the region of bytes pointed to by `x` +(for (3) and (4))+.
For (1) and (2), the bits of `x` are zero indexed starting with the
least significant bit (and the most significant bit is the sign bit if
`X` is signed).
For (3) and (4), the bits of the region of bytes pointed to by `x` are
zero indexed starting with the least significant bit of the first byte.

`X`, `Q`, and `R` may be any {ce_std_is_integral_url}[integer types].
If `x` is a null pointer, `q` is negative, `r` is negative, or
stem:[\mathtt{q} \cdot \mathtt{CHAR\_BIT} + \mathtt{r}]
is greater than or equal to the number of nonpadding bits in `X` or the
number of bits in the region of bytes pointed to by `x`, the behavior is
undefined.
For (2) and (4), `q` is omitted and taken to be zero.

Prior to {cpp}20, signed integers are permitted to use ones`' complement
or sign-magnitude representation instead of two`'s complement.
This does not affect the behavior of (1) or (2).
