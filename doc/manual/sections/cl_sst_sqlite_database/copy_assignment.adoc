Copy assignment overwrites `*this` with `other` as follows:

. {empty}
For each database that exists in both `*this` and `other`, the database
in `*this` is overwritten with the database from `other`.
The `main` database always exists, so this step always occurs for the
`main` database.
No other databases always exist, not even the `temp` database, which
only comes into existence upon first use.

. {empty}
For each database that exists only in `other`, a new `:memory:` database
is attached to `*this` and overwritten with the database from `other`.
However, if the database in question is the `temp` database, then it
cannot be attached, so it will instead be brought into existence by
executing a `CREATE TEMP TABLE` statement before being overwritten.

. {empty}
For each database that exists only in `*this`, the database is detached
from `*this`.
However, if the database in question is the `temp` database, then it
cannot be detached, so it will instead have all of its entities dropped.
