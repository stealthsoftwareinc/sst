[#bl-general-development-guidelines]
= General development guidelines

This section provides guidelines for using the SST Bash library and
writing Bash code in general.

The minimum version of Bash supported by the SST Bash library is Bash
{bl_minimum_bash_version}.
However, development work is typically done on a system with a newer
version of Bash.
This makes it easy to accidentally introduce subtle dependencies on the
newer version, which you may want to avoid depending on the constraints
of your project.
This section provides a set of guidelines that you can follow to reduce
problems when aiming to support Bash {bl_minimum_bash_version}.
