[subs="{sst_subs_normal}"]
Since `{fp_namespace}::{fp_wrapper}` is publicly derived from
`{cl_std_integral_constant}<{fp_wrapper_value_type}, {fp_wrapper_value_name}>`,
there are two ways to extract the underlying value
`{fp_wrapper_value_name}`.
The first way is to write
`{fp_namespace}::{fp_wrapper}<{fp_wrapper_template_type}>::value`.
This directly accesses the underlying value and always works as
expected.
The second way is to write
`{fp_namespace}::{fp_wrapper}<{fp_wrapper_template_type}>()`.
This constructs an instance of `{fp_namespace}::{fp_wrapper}`, which
will be implicitly converted to the underlying value in most contexts,
but not all.
It is recommended to always use the first way.
