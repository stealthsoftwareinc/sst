[#bl-sst-set-exit]
= The `sst_set_exit` function

.Bash
[source,subs="{sst_subs_source}"]
----
include::partials/bl_include_prelude.adoc[]

sst_set_exit [<status>]
----

The `{bl_sst_set_exit}` function takes no action and returns with exit
status `<status>`.
If `<status>` is omitted, it is taken to be the exit status of the last
command executed, in which case the call is effectively a noop.
