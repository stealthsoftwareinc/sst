[#bl-sst-parse-opt]
= The `sst_parse_opt` function

sst_parse_opt [<prefix=>] (<option>... | <matcher>())
              [<style=required>] (: "$@" | :<&array>[:<i=0>])
----

The `{bl_sst_parse_opt}` function attempts to parse an option from the
beginning of a list of command-line arguments.

When `{bl_sst_parse_opt}` returns, the following variables will have
been updated in the calling context:

`<prefix>got`::
A {bl_boolean_value} indicating whether an option was parsed.

`<prefix>opt`::
The option that was parsed, or unset if an option was not parsed.

`<prefix>arg`::
The option argument that was parsed, or unset if an option argument was
not parsed.

`<prefix>pop`::
A code fragment that you should execute with `{bl_eval}` immediately
after the `{bl_sst_parse_opt}` call returns.
If an option was parsed, the code fragment will remove the option from
the list of command-line arguments so that `{bl_sst_parse_opt}` may be
called again to attempt to parse another option.
Otherwise, the code fragment will do nothing.
