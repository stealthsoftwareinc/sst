= The `sst_expect_extension` function

.Bash
[source,subs="normal"]
----
++sst_expect_extension <path> <extension>++
----

The `sst_expect_extension` function verifies that the final component of
`<path>` ends with `<extension>`, but is not solely `<extension>`.

Technically speaking, this function verifies that `<extension>` is a
trailing substring of `<path>` that is preceded by at least one
non-slash character.
