[#cl-sstCryptoRng]
= The `sstCryptoRng` requirement

A type `G` satisfies the `{cl_sstCryptoRng}` requirement if all of the
following hold:

. {empty}
`G` satisfies the `{cl_UniformRandomBitGenerator}` requirement.

. {empty}
If `g` is an object of type `G`, then the sequence of all random values
produced by any overload of ``g``{empty}`'s `operator()` function
throughout ``g``{empty}`'s lifetime is {cryptographically_secure}.
