[#bl-sst-expect-not-subshell]
= The `sst_expect_not_subshell` function

.Bash
[source,subs="{sst_subs_source}"]

sst_expect_not_subshell [<function>]
----

The `{bl_sst_expect_not_subshell}` function verifies that the current
code is not running in a {bl_subshell}.
include::partials/bl_if_the_verification_fails.adoc[]

The error message will state that `<function>` must not be called in a
subshell.
If `<function>` is omitted, it is inferred as the name of the calling
function.
If `<function>` is a single "```-```" character, the error message will
instead generically state that the current code must not be run in a
subshell.
