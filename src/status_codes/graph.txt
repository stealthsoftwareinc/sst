# This file is the single source of truth for the status code graph.
#
#    1. Empty lines, lines consisting of only space characters,
#       and lines whose first non-space character is a "#"
#       character are ignored.
#
#    2. Each line that contains a value followed by a name defines
#       a status code.
#
#    3. Each line that contains a status code name x followed by
#       another status code name y defines an implication from x
#       to y. Redundant implications are acceptable, as the graph
#       will be automatically reduced via transitive reduction.
#
#    4. Space characters can freely be used for alignment purposes
#       anywhere in any line.
